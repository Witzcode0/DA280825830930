# A data type in Python is a classification that specifies which type of value a variable has and what type of operations can be performed on it. Python supports various built-in data types.

# primitive data_type

# age = 35 # int

# weight = 67.657 # float

# firstname = "brijesh gondaliya" # string

# complex = 30 + 65j # complex

# # Non-primitive data_type

# nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6] # list

# odd = (1,3,5,7,9) # tuple

# even = {2,4,6,8,10} # set


# import sys
# age = 28
# print(age)
# print(type(age)) # <class 'int'>


# print(sys.getsizeof(age))

# weight = 56.763474
# print(type(weight))

# firstname = "hghgshdygus"
# print(type(firstname))


# There are two main types of type conversion in Python: 

# Implicit Type Conversion (Coercion):

# num1 = 10
# num2 = 2.5
# num3 = num1 + num2 
# print(num3)
# print(type(num3))

# num1 = 10
# num2 = 20
# num3 = num1 + num2
# print(num3)
# print(type(num3))

# Explicit Type Conversion (Type Casting): 

# age = 10
# float_age = float(age)
# print(float_age)
# print(type(float_age))

# s_age = str(age)
# print(s_age)
# print(type(s_age))
