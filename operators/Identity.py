# Identity Operators:
# Used to check if two variables refer to the same object in memory. 
# is (Returns True if both variables are the same object)
# is not (Returns True if both variables are not the same object)

# num1 = 10
# num2 = 20
# num3 = 10
# num4 = "10"

# print(num1 is num2)
# print(num1 is num3)
# print(num1 is not num3)
# print(num1 is num4)
# print(id(num1))
# print(id(num4))

# num1 = 10
# num2 = 10
# print(id(num1))
# print(id(num2))
